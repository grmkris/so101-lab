## 2026-07-16 — baseline state (backfill)

- Best policy so far: `kris0/act_pickplace_v052c` — 50k steps, loss 0.062, trained on Colab with git-checkout `05a52238` (0.5.2) to match the 0.5.2 record/infer stack.
- dataset: `kris0/so101_pickplace_clean` — 47 eps, random position (continuous, no clustering), but grasp wrist_roll spans 146° → orientation too varied for the dataset size.
- result: descends fully, grasp flaky; strongly lighting-dependent (works ~120 brightness, fails ~50–60).
- Earlier attempts: 0.6.1-trained models on 0.5.2 inference stopped ~70% down — the version-mismatch bug. `lerobot-replay` (perfect playback) is what isolated it.
- Next: LeLab (latest lerobot, whole loop one version), v3 dataset 60–80 eps with consistent orientation + locked lights.
